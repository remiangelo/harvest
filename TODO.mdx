# Harvest App: Development Roadmap

This document outlines the features and technical plan to build a fully-featured version of the "Harvest" dating app.

## Recommended Tech Stack

To build a robust and scalable application efficiently, we will use the following technologies:

- **Frontend**:
  - **SwiftUI**: Continue using SwiftUI for a modern, declarative, and native iOS UI.

- **Backend (Backend-as-a-Service)**:
  - **Supabase**: An open-source Firebase alternative that uses a suite of powerful tools built on enterprise-grade technologies.
    - **Database**: A dedicated **PostgreSQL** database, offering the full power of relational SQL for storing user profiles, swipes, matches, and chat messages.
    - **Authentication**: **Supabase Auth** for secure sign-up, login (including social providers like Apple and Google), and user session management.
    - **Storage**: **Supabase Storage** for securely uploading, storing, and serving user-provided assets like photos and videos.
    - **Serverless Logic**: **Supabase Edge Functions** (Deno-based TypeScript) to run backend code for complex tasks like creating a match or sending a notification without managing a server.
    - **Push Notifications**: We will trigger **Apple's Push Notification Service (APNs)** from an Edge Function to send real-time notifications for new matches and messages.

## Feature Development To-Do List

Here's a breakdown of the tasks required to make "Harvest" a complete app using the recommended Supabase stack.

### Phase 1: Core Backend & Authentication

- [ ] **Set up Supabase Project**: Create a new project on the Supabase platform and integrate the Swift SDK into the Xcode project.
- [ ] **Design Database Schema**:
  - [ ] Define the tables in PostgreSQL (e.g., `users`, `swipes`, `matches`, `messages`).
  - [ ] Set up table relationships and constraints.
- [ ] **Implement User Authentication**:
  - [ ] Connect the onboarding flow to create a new user in Supabase Auth.
  - [ ] Create a "Welcome Back" / Login screen.
  - [ ] Implement session persistence using the Supabase Swift client.
  - [ ] Add a logout function in the profile screen.
- [ ] **Profile Management Backend**:
  - [ ] When a user completes onboarding, save their data to a new row in the `users` table.
  - [ ] Implement logic to upload photos to a "profile-photos" bucket in Supabase Storage and save the URLs in the `users` table.
  - [ ] Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables to ensure users can only access and modify their own data.

### Phase 2: Core Frontend Functionality

- [ ] **Connect Frontend to Backend**:
  - [ ] Modify the `OnboardingFlowView` to save the final `OnboardingData` to your Supabase backend.
  - [ ] Update the `ProfileCardView` to fetch and display real user data from the `users` table.
  - [ ] Implement the "Profile Edit" screen to read and write changes to the user's row in the `users` table.
- [ ] **Implement Swiping & Matching**:
  - [ ] Fetch a queue of potential matches from the `users` table based on user preferences.
  - [ ] When a user swipes right (likes), insert a row into the `swipes` table.
  - [ ] Create a Supabase Edge Function that triggers on a new "like." This function will check if the swipe is mutual.
  - [ ] If it's a mutual like, create a "match" by inserting a new row into the `matches` table that links the two users.
- [ ] **Display Matches**:
  - [ ] Create a "Matches" screen or section.
  - [ ] This screen will subscribe to real-time changes in the `matches` table and display a list of users you've matched with.

### Phase 3: Real-Time Chat

- [ ] **Chat Backend**:
  - [ ] Set up the `messages` table with Row Level Security.
  - [ ] Enable real-time functionality on the `messages` table.
- [ ] **Chat UI**:
  - [ ] When a user taps on a match, navigate them to the `ChatView`.
  - [ ] The `ChatView` should subscribe to the `messages` table for that specific match to display messages in real-time.
  - [ ] Implement the input field to send new messages by inserting rows into the `messages` table.
  - [ ] Use Supabase's real-time presence feature to show when a user is online or typing.

### Phase 4: Polish & Advanced Features

- [ ] **Push Notifications**:
  - [ ] Integrate the APNs SDK and request notification permissions from the user.
  - [ ] Create an Edge Function that is called when a new match or message is created.
  - [ ] This function will construct and send a payload to APNs to deliver a push notification to the correct user.
- [ ] **Advanced Profile Features**:
  - [ ] Implement user reporting and blocking functionality.
  - [ ] Add more detailed profile fields (e.g., job, education, interests).
  - [ ] Implement advanced filtering for matches (age range, distance, interests) using SQL queries.
- [ ] **Monetization (Optional)**:
  - [ ] Design premium features (e.g., "Super Likes," seeing who liked you, unlimited swipes).
  - [ ] Integrate RevenueCat or StoreKit to handle in-app purchases and subscriptions, using a Supabase table to track user subscription status.
- [ ] **UI/UX Refinement**:
  - [ ] Add loading indicators for all network operations.
  - [ ] Implement smooth animations and screen transitions.
  - [ ] Conduct thorough testing on different devices and iOS versions.
